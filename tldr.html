                <li>My name is Esme Jarrell.</li>
                <li>I'm a carpenter—some say magician.</li>
                <li>I design, build, and install custom interior carpentry projects like built-ins, pantries, and closets.</li>
                <li>I work one-on-one with clients to bring ideas to life—anything is possible with clear planning, realistic budgets, and quality craftsmanship.</li>
                <li>I use only high-quality hardware—cutting costs here isn't worth it in the long run.</li>
                <li>You'll work directly with me—no middlemen, no confusion.</li>
                <li>I serve Atlanta, GA and surrounding areas.</li>
                <li>I'm typically booked out 2–3 months in advance.</li>
                <li>First step: email me your vision, photos of your space, rough measurements, and any inspiration images you love.</li>
